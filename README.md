# HtmlTestReport
Test runner which creates a report HTML.
This is a trial version, my first Python program. The solution consists of three short unit tests in accordance with the Page Object Model. 
Following this model, each web page to be tested corresponds to a Unit Test. 
The HtmTestReport library (modified) represents the main program that calls the test suite. The software is configurable through a configuration file and 
produces a logging file.
